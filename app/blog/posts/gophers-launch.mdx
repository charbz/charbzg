summary: 'Introducing Gophers, The generic collections package for Go.'
---

After learning Scala for a small project at work, I was amazed at the flexibility and power of the standard collections library.
The sheer number of useful methods associated with Lists, Vectors, Seqs, and Sets really impressed me. 
It forced me to think of the problem I was solving as a series of concise transformations on collections of data, nothing more, nothing less.

Jumping back to Go, I realized that I was missing out on the same conveniences and wanted to do something about it. 

With [Generics](https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics) and [Iterators](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.23#iterators) now fully supported in Go since 1.18 and 1.23 respectively, 
I realized that this was the perfect time to **build my own generic collections package and open source it**.

## Gophers

After tinkering with a few different approaches and running into a some gotchas, I finally settled on an API that felt natural and easy to use.

Before diving into package details, let's take a look at a few examples of how you can use Gophers.

#### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/charbz/gophers
```

#### Example Usage

```go
import (
  "github.com/charbz/gophers/list"
)

// Create some custom data type Foo
type Foo struct {
  a int
  b string
}

// Create a List of Foo
foos := list.NewList([]Foo{
  {a: 1, b: "one"}, 
  {a: 2, b: "two"}, 
  {a: 3, b: "three"}, 
  {a: 4, b: "four"}, 
  {a: 5, b: "five"},
})

// Now the fun begins


foos.Filter(func(f Foo) bool { return f.a%2 == 0 }) 
// output:
// {{2 two} {4 four}}

foos.FilterNot(func(f Foo) bool { return f.a%2 == 0 }) 
// output:
// {{1 one} {3 three} {5 five}}

foos.Find(func(f Foo) bool { return f.a == 3 }) 
// output:
// {a: 3, b: "three"}

foos.Partition(func(f Foo) bool { return len(f.b) == 3 })
// output:
// {{1 one} {2 two}} , {{3 three} {4 four} {5 five}}

foos.SplitAt(3) 
// output:
// {{1 one} {2 two} {3 three} {4 four}} , {{5 five}}

foos.Count(func(f Foo) bool { return f.a < 3 }) 
// output:
// 2

bars := foos.Concat(list.NewList([]Foo{{a: 1, b: "one"}, {a: 2, b: "two"}})) 
// output:
// {{1 one} {2 two} {3 three} {4 four} {5 five} {1 one} {2 two}}

bars.Distinct(func(i Foo, j Foo) bool { return i.a == j.a }) 
// output:
// {{1 one} {2 two} {3 three} {4 four} {5 five}}

foos.Apply(
  func(f Foo) Foo {
    f.a *= 2
    f.b += " * two"
    return f
  }
)
// output:
// {{2 one * two} {4 two * two} {6 three * two} {8 four * two} {10 five * two}}
```

That's just the tip of the iceberg, the package is filled with a ton of useful methods for building and transforming collections,
as well as support for a variety of different collection types. Check out the [Readme](https://github.com/charbz/gophers) or the [GoDocs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/charbz/gophers) for more details.

## Design Decisions

First I created an interface that would represent any Collection in the package:

```go
type Collection[T any] interface {
	Add(T)
	Length() int
	New(s ...[]T) Collection[T]
	Values() iter.Seq[T]
}
```
At a minimum, a collection must be able to add some element to itself (regardless of insertion order), return the number of elements it contains, and return an iterator over its elements.

Then, I quickly realized that some of the methods I wanted to build such as <span className="text-sm">`Filter`, `Map`, `Reduce`</span> can apply to all collection types, while others such as <span className="text-sm">`Reverse`, `Sort`, `SplitAt`</span> only apply to ordered collections where index-based access is meaningful.

This is where the <span className="text-sm">`OrderedCollection`</span> interface comes in.

```go
type OrderedCollection[T any] interface {
	Collection[T]
	At(index int) T
	All() iter.Seq2[int, T]
	Backward() iter.Seq2[int, T]
	Slice(start, end int) OrderedCollection[T]
	NewOrdered(s ...[]T) OrderedCollection[T]
}
```

The interfaces are designed to be as minimal as possible, I only wanted to include the methods that would be enough to qualify something as a collection, while the fancier methods can be added to the concrete types.
Then I proceeded to implement a few basic collection types that would satisfy the interfaces.

### Collection Types:

##### Sequence
  - an ordered collection wrapping a Go slice. 
  - great for fast random access.
<br/>

##### ComparableSequence
  - a Sequence of comparable elements. 
  - offers extra functionality.
<br/>

##### List
  - an ordered collection wrapping a linked list. 
  - great for fast insertion, removal, and implementing stacks and queues.
<br/>

##### ComparableList
  - a List of comparable elements. 
  - offers extra functionality.
<br/>

##### Set
  - a hash set of unique elements.
  - offers set operations such as union, intersection, and diff.

### Generic Functions

In order to reduce code duplication, I created a few generic functions that accept any Collection[T] as an argument, apply some transfomration, and return a new Collection[T] as the result.
These can be found in the *functions.go* and *ordered_functions.go* files. 

Here's an example of the generic <span className="text-sm">`Filter`</span> function:

```go
// Filter returns a new collection containing only the elements that
// satisfy the predicate function.
//
// example usage:
//
//	numbers := NewSequence([]int{1,2,3,4,5,6})
//	Filter(numbers, func(t int) bool { return t % 2 == 0 })
//
// output:
//
//	[2,4,6]
func Filter[T any](s Collection[T], f func(T) bool) Collection[T] {
	result := s.New()
	for v := range s.Values() {
		if f(v) {
			result.Add(v)
		}
	}
	return result
}
```

### Collection Methods

Now that I have my logic written in a generic function, I can create a new method on the concrete collection types that call the generic function.
This would allow me to write something like <span className="text-sm">`sequence.Filter(...)`</span> which is more natural. 

```go
func (s *Sequence[T]) Filter(f func(T) bool) *Sequence[T] {
	return Filter(s, f).(*Sequence[T])
}
```

This pattern is followed across the board except in places where the concrete type needs to implement the method natively for efficiency.

## What's Next?

I'm excited to see where this project goes, I have a few more ideas of how to expand the package and make it more useful.

- Add more collection types
- Add more generic functions
- Add benchmarks
- Improve the efficiency of some methods
- Add Iterators: instead of returning a slice, return an iterator that yields values one at a time.
- Add support for Monads
